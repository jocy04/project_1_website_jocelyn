  <h1> My thoughts about a favorite book of Dr.seuss</h1>
  <p>My favorite book of Dr.Seuss is green eggs and ham.He is talking about not eating green eggs and ham and the other character is trying to tell him to eat it.Also if he ate he will eat it anywhere.Green eggs and ham is important because I read it when I was little child.Why because I am trying new things.
